    "## 📘 Project Introduction\n",
    "This project explores user behavior prediction in a news recommendation scenario. The goal is to build a model that can predict a user's future click behavior based on their historical browsing and clicking behavior data, specifically the last news article they clicked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting is inspired by a real-world news app, where delivering timely, relevant content is essential for user engagement. This project aims to simulate a practical recommender system, combining business intuition with machine learning techniques to address a realistic problem in the content recommendation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Data Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains user interaction data from a large-scale news platform, including:\n",
    "- 300,000 users\n",
    "- ~3 million clicks\n",
    "- 360,000+ unique news articles; each news article is represented by a pre-trained embedding vector, capturing semantic relationships between articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted click log data from 200,000 users as the training set, 50,000 users as test set A, and 50,000 users as test set B.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📏 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The final recommendation for each user will include five recommended articles, sorted by click probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for user1, our recommendation would be:\n",
    "> user1, article1, article2, article3, article4, article5.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one correct answer for each user's last clicked article, so we check if any of the recommended five articles match the actual answer. We will use **mean reciprocal rank** as the evaluation metric. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "score(user) = \\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{s(user, k)}{k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If article1 is the actual article clicked by the user, then s(user1, 1) = 1, and s(user1, 2-4) are all 0. If article2 is the article clicked by the user, then s(user, 2) = 1/2, and s(user, 1, 3, 4, 5) are all 0. Thus, score(user) = the reciprocal of the rank at which the match occurs. If there are no matches, score(user1) = 0. This is reasonable because we want hits to be as high-ranking as possible, which yields a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Project Understanding\n",
    "The goal of this project is to **predict the last news article a user clicked, based on their historical browsing data**. Unlike traditional structured prediction problems, this is more aligned with real-world recommendation systems, using raw user click logs rather than neatly labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this, I framed the task as a **supervised learning** problem by transforming user-article interactions into \"features + labels\" training data. The core idea is to predict the likelihood of a user clicking a given article, turning this into a click-through rate (CTR) prediction task. This reframing allows for the use of **classification models**—starting with simple baselines like logistic regression and moving toward deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have converted this problem into a classification problem, where the classification label is whether the user will click on a particular article. The features of the classification problem will include the user and the article. We need to train a classification model to predict the probability of a particular user clicking on a specific article. This raises several additional questions:\n",
    "- How to create training and testing datasets?\n",
    "- What specific features can we leverage?\n",
    "- What models can we attempt?\n",
    "- With 360,000 articles and over 200,000 users, what strategies do we have to reduce the problem's scale? How do we make the final predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the third part, we will prepare new features for each user's recalled list. These feature will be used in the ranking model in the fourth part.**"

    "## Converting to a Supervised Learning Problem\n",
    "To prepare our data for machine learning, we need to convert it into a supervised learning problem with features and labels. The features we can use directly from our initial data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Features**: These are the inherent properties of each article, such as its category_id, created_at_ts (creation timestamp, which indicates its timeliness), and words_count. These help us understand user preferences for content type, newness, and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Embedding Features**: These are the vector representations of article content, which we've used in the recall phase. We can also use Word2Vec or BERT to create new embedding features that contain semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Device Features**: Information about the user's device provides a useful context for their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Supervised Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recall phase gives us a dictionary in the format {user_id: [list of potential articles]}. We can use this to build our training set. For each user and each potential article in their list, we'll create a data point. For example, if user1's recall list is {user1: [item1, item2, item3]}, our dataset will have three rows: (user1, item1), (user1, item2), and (user1, item3). These also form the first two feature columns of our supervised test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing New Features from Historical Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A key insight from the data analysis (Part 1) is that a user's final click is strongly correlated with their recent clicks. Therefore, our most important features will be a combination of the user's historical behavior and the candidate article. For each candidate article, we will create the following features based on its relationship to the user's most recent clicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Similarity Features: Calculate the similarity (e.g., using the inner product of embeddings) between the candidate item and the last few articles the user clicked. This directly captures the user's most recent interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical Features of Similarity: Compute statistical measures like the average or standard deviation of the similarity features. This can help smooth out noise and capture broader trends in a user's preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Word Count Difference: Calculate the difference in word count between the candidate item and the user's most recently clicked articles. This can reveal preferences for article length.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Time Difference: Calculate the time gap between the candidate article's creation time and the user's last click time. This is a powerful feature for understanding a user's preference for timely content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. User-item similarity obtained from YouTubeDNN recall: Create a similarity feature between the user and the candidate item itself, which can be very informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will implement the creation of these features. The logic is as follows:\n",
    "1. First, we'll get a user's last click and their historical clicks from the click log data.\n",
    "2. Next, we'll create the new features using the user's historical click data, the recall list, article information, and embedding vectors.\n",
    "3. Finally, we'll create the labels to form our supervised learning dataset."

    "After the recall phase, we're left with a list of positive items (what a user clicked) and a huge number of negative items (what they didn't click). This creates a massive class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem: Imbalanced Data\n",
    "The data is extremely imbalanced. For each positive click (label 1), there are thousands of negative examples (label 0). Training a model on this skewed data would lead it to simply predict \"not clicked\" for everything, resulting in a useless model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution: Downsampling\n",
    "To solve this, we downsample the negative samples. This means we selectively choose a smaller number of negative examples to create a more balanced ratio between positive and negative data points. This serves two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mitigates Imbalance: It makes the ratio of positive to negative samples more manageable, allowing the model to learn what a \"click\" looks like rather than just what a \"non-click\" looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces Computation: It drastically reduces the size of the training dataset, which makes feature engineering and model training significantly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Considerations for Downsampling\n",
    "When performing negative downsampling, we follow these important rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only the negative samples are downsampled. All positive samples should be retained.\n",
    "2. After downsampling, ensure that all users and items that appeared in the original data are still present in the new, smaller dataset.\n",
    "3. The ratio of positive to negative samples is a hyperparameter we need to tune. We will try different ratios to see what works best for your model.\n",
    "4. Since downsampling changes the dataset, it's crucial to update our user recall lists to reflect the new data. This ensures that any subsequent features, especially those related to a user's position or history, are accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we're performing the negative downsampling early because creating ranking features for the full, imbalanced dataset would be too slow. This strategic step helps make the entire process more efficient."

    "Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. Here's a summary of the key techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Text Feature Engineering\n",
    "- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, removing irrelevant characters, symbols, or punctuation, removing duplicated/noisy/missing data, performing stemming or lemmatization, and handling named entities.\n",
    "- **Text Length Features**: Create features based on the length of a news article's title or body, such as character count, word count, or sentence count.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to extract the emotional tone of an article as a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. User Behavior Features\n",
    "- **Time Interval Features**: Calculate the time gap between user actions, such as the interval between clicks on two different articles.\n",
    "- **User Behavior Sequence**: Sequence a user's historical actions and use a sequence model (e.g., RNN, LSTM) to extract features.\n",
    "- **User Interest Tags**: Use clustering or topic modeling to build interest tags that represent a user's preferences for different topics or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Article Attribute Features\n",
    "- **Topic Modeling**: Use models like LDA or LSA to identify and use the topics of articles as features.\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert an article's category into a numerical feature using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "- **Title Keywords**: Extract keywords from article titles to use as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. Contextual Features\n",
    "- **Geographic Features**: Use a user's location or an article's location tags as features.\n",
    "- **Time Features**: Convert timestamps into features like season, weekday/weekend, or holiday.\n",
    "- **User Device Features**: Use information about a user's device, operating system, or browser type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. Embedding and Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Use a Word2Vec model (or a transformer-based one such as BERT) to convert article titles or bodies into low-dimensional, dense vectors.\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Weighted Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the dimensionality of TF-IDF weighted features to remove noise and make them more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### f. Feature Crossing and Combination\n",
    "- **Feature Combination**: Combine multiple features, such as a user's interest tag with an article's category.\n",
    "- **Feature Crossing**: Perform feature crossing for categorical features, such as combining a user's click count for a certain category with an article's category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### g. Handling Missing Values and Outliers\n",
    "- **Missing Value Imputation**: Fill in missing feature values with methods like the mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "- **Outlier Treatment**: Detect and handle outliers using methods like the Z-Score or box plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### h. Feature Selection and Importance\n",
    "- **Variance Thresholding**: Remove features with a low variance, assuming they have little predictive power.\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate the correlation between features and the target variable to select the most relevant ones.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance Ranking**: Use a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, GBDT) to rank features by their importance and select the most significant ones."

    "1. Retrieve Recent Clicks: For every user, get the item_ids of the last N articles they clicked.\n",
    "2. Generate Candidate-Specific Features: For each candidate article, calculate the following features by comparing it to the user's last N clicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity Statistics**: Compute statistical features (sum, max, min, mean) of the similarity between the candidate article and the user's last N clicked articles (e.g., using embedding similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-Based Features**: Calculate the time difference between the candidate article's creation time and the creation times of the last N clicked articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Length Features**: Determine the word count difference between the candidate article and the last N clicked articles.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Inherent Article Features\n",
    "- **Article Word Count**: The number of words in an article indicates its length. This helps us understand a user's preference for long-form vs. short-form content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Creation Time**: An article's creation timestamp reflects its freshness. This can be used to gauge a user's preference for timely, up-to-date news.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Embedding**: Converting articles into low-dimensional, dense vectors (e.g., via Word2Vec or BERT) helps us capture the semantic similarity between articles, which is crucial for improving recommendation accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. User Click Environment Features\n",
    "- **Device Information**: Features related to a user's device type, operating system, or browser can reflect their habits and preferences, helping us deliver personalized content for their specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Users Behavior and Article Popularity Features\n",
    "- **User Activity**: We can create features that reflect a user's activeness by counting their total clicks and analyzing the time intervals between their clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Article Popularity**: We'll build features to measure an article's popularity or \"hotness\" by analyzing its total click count and the distribution of clicks over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Timeliness Preference**: By comparing the click times of a user's historical articles to their creation times, we can understand their preference for content timeliness and recommend articles accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Topic Preferences**: We can build features that represent a user's favorite topics by statistically analyzing the categories of their past clicks. This helps us predict if a new article belongs to a topic they've previously engaged with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Reading Length Preference**: By analyzing the word counts of a user's historical articles (e.g., calculating the average word count), we can create a feature that reflects their preference for a specific article length."
