    "## 📘 Project Introduction\n",
    "This project explores user behavior prediction in a news recommendation scenario. The goal is to build a model that can predict a user's future click behavior based on their historical browsing and clicking behavior data, specifically the last news article they clicked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setting is inspired by a real-world news app, where delivering timely, relevant content is essential for user engagement. This project aims to simulate a practical recommender system, combining business intuition with machine learning techniques to address a realistic problem in the content recommendation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Data Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains user interaction data from a large-scale news platform, including:\n",
    "- 300,000 users\n",
    "- ~3 million clicks\n",
    "- 360,000+ unique news articles; each news article is represented by a pre-trained embedding vector, capturing semantic relationships between articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted click log data from 200,000 users as the training set, 50,000 users as test set A, and 50,000 users as test set B.\n",

    "## 📏 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The final recommendation for each user will include five recommended articles, sorted by click probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for user1, our recommendation would be:\n",
    "> user1, article1, article2, article3, article4, article5.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one correct answer for each user's last clicked article, so we check if any of the recommended five articles match the actual answer. We will use **mean reciprocal rank** as the evaluation metric. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "score(user) = \\sum_{k=1}^5 \\frac{s(user, k)}{k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If article1 is the actual article clicked by the user, then s(user1, 1) = 1, and s(user1, 2-4) are all 0. If article2 is the article clicked by the user, then s(user, 2) = 1/2, and s(user, 1, 3, 4, 5) are all 0. Thus, score(user) = the reciprocal of the rank at which the match occurs. If there are no matches, score(user1) = 0. This is reasonable because we want hits to be as high-ranking as possible, which yields a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Project Understanding\n",
    "The goal of this project is to **predict the last news article a user clicked, based on their historical browsing data**. Unlike traditional structured prediction problems, this is more aligned with real-world recommendation systems, using raw user click logs rather than neatly labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this, I framed the task as a **supervised learning** problem by transforming user-article interactions into \"features + labels\" training data. The core idea is to predict the likelihood of a user clicking a given article, turning this into a click-through rate (CTR) prediction task. This reframing allows for the use of **classification models**—starting with simple baselines like logistic regression and moving toward deep learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have converted this problem into a classification problem, where the classification label is whether the user will click on a particular article. The features of the classification problem will include the user and the article. We need to train a classification model to predict the probability of a particular user clicking on a specific article. This raises several additional questions:\n",
    "- How to create training and testing datasets?\n",
    "- What specific features can we leverage?\n",
    "- What models can we attempt?\n",
    "- With 360,000 articles and over 200,000 users, what strategies do we have to reduce the problem's scale? How do we make the final predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the second part, we will use a multi-channel recall strategy to create a set of candidate news articles for the recommendation system. This approach is also designed to solve the cold-start problem for new users.**"

    "Multi-channel recall is a powerful strategy that uses several different methods to generate a diverse pool of relevant content.\n",
    "- **Multiple Strategies**: The system uses a variety of simple, fast methods to find potential recommendations. Each method, or \"channel,\" looks at the data from a different angle. For example, one channel might find articles similar to what the user has clicked on before, while another might find the most popular articles overall.\n",
    "- **Balancing Speed and Quality**: These channels are designed to be fast, so the system can quickly find a large number of candidates. This keeps the recommendation process from being slow. By using many diverse channels, the system ensures a **high recall rate**, meaning it's very likely to find the most relevant items, which then perform well in the final ranking stage.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Because each channel operates independently, they can all run at the same time using multi-threading. This parallel processing significantly speeds up the entire process."

    "The weighted similarity considers:\n",
    "- **Positional Weight** `loc_weight = loc_alpha * (0.9 ** (np.abs(loc2 - loc1) - 1))`: This weight accounts for the order and distance of a user's clicks. `loc_alpha = 1.0 if loc2 > loc1 else 0.7` is a directional modifier. It assigns a higher value (1.0) if a user clicks article j after article i, and a lower value (0.7) if the order is reversed. This gives more importance to the most recent behavior. The positional weight decays exponentially based on the distance between the clicks `np.abs(loc2 - loc1)`. The further apart the two clicks are in a user's history, the smaller this weight becomes. The 0.9 is a decay coefficient that controls how quickly this weight diminishes.\n",
    "- **Click Time Weight** `click_time_weight = np.exp(0.7 ** np.abs(i_click_time - j_click_time))`: This weight is based on how much time passed between a user's clicks on articles i and j. The closer the clicks are in time, the higher the weight. This assumes that a user's interests are more similar for items they engage with in quick succession. The 0.7 is a decay coefficient that controls the speed of this decay.\n",
    "- **Article Creation Time Weight** `created_time_weight = np.exp(0.8 ** np.abs(item_created_time_dict[i] - item_created_time_dict[j]))`: This weight considers the freshness of the articles themselves. It gives a higher weight to articles that were created around the same time. This can capture trends where users are interested in a specific topic that is currently being published. The 0.8 is the decay coefficient.\n",
    "- **Final Similarity Score** `i2i_sim[i][j] += loc_weight * click_time_weight * created_time_weight / math.log(len(item_time_list) + 1)`: The final similarity score `i2i_sim[i][j]` is a composite of the above factors. It's calculated by multiplying the three weights together (loc_weight * click_time_weight * created_time_weight) and then dividing by a logarithmic term math.log(len(item_time_list) + 1). This final division is a normalization step to prevent a single user's frequent clicks from disproportionately inflating the similarity score."

    "### 6.3 Item Embedding Similarity\n",
    "Item embedding similarity is a method for finding articles that are semantically or contextually similar to each other. Every article is represented by a unique vector (an \"embedding\") in a high-dimensional space. The closer two vectors are in this space, the more similar the articles they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for new articles that have no click data (a cold-start scenario). By comparing a new article's embedding to the embeddings of all other articles in the database, we can find a set of similar articles that can be recommended to users who have previously shown an interest in that topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Introduction to Faiss\n",
    "Faiss is a core component in modern recommendation systems. Developed by Facebook's AI team, it is a high-performance library built for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a large-scale recommendation system, simply calculating the similarity between every item and every other item taking a prohibitive amount of time during online inference. Faiss solves this problem by using advanced algorithms that can perform an approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that instead of finding the perfect nearest neighbor, Faiss finds a vector that is a very close approximation, and it does so in a fraction of the time. This trade-off between absolute accuracy and speed is essential for real-world applications where a massive search must be completed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key benefit of Faiss is its ability to find the top-k most similar vectors to a given query vector at an incredible speed**, making it the perfect tool for the vector recall stage of a recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Principle of Faiss Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index Structure Construction:**  \n",
    "   In Faiss, the first step is to build an index structure for the vector dataset to be searched. Faiss provides various index structures, such as flat indexes, inverted file indexes (IVF), and product quantization indexes (PQ). Each index structure is suited to specific scenarios and requirements, allowing users to choose the most appropriate one based on their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Encoding:**  \n",
    "   Before constructing the index structure, vector data typically needs to be encoded. The purpose of encoding is to map high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional space to reduce computation and storage costs. Common encoding methods include vector quantization and hash encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Process:**  \n",
    "   Once the index structure is built, queries can be performed on it. The query process involves calculating the similarity between the query vector and the vectors stored in the index structure. Faiss provides multiple query methods, such as exact search and approximate search. In approximate search, Faiss uses algorithms such as Product Quantization (PQ) and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to accelerate the search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Retrieval:**  \n",
    "   After the query is complete, Faiss returns the indexes or distances of the top-k most similar vectors. Users can specify the number of results they need and process or analyze the returned results further.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product Quantization (PQ):**  \n",
    "   - PQ divides a high-dimensional vector into multiple sub-vectors and independently quantizes each sub-vector. This maps the original high-dimensional vector into a lower-dimensional subspace, reducing computation and storage requirements.\n",
    "   - The key to PQ lies in how the original vector is divided into sub-vectors and how appropriate quantization methods are designed. Common methods include Product Quantization and Residual Product Quantization.\n",
    "   - PQ significantly reduces search time while maintaining search quality, making it especially useful for large-scale high-dimensional data in approximate nearest neighbor searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH):**  \n",
    "   - LSH is a hash-based method for approximate nearest neighbor search. Its core idea is to map similar vectors into the same bucket so that similar vectors can be quickly located during the query.\n",
    "   - LSH uses multiple hash functions to generate several hash values for each vector, which are then used to map the vectors into buckets. During a query, only the vectors in the query vector’s bucket and neighboring buckets are searched, eliminating the need to traverse the entire dataset.\n",

    "The recall phase is a crucial first step in a recommendation system. Its job is to quickly narrow down a vast number of items to a smaller, more manageable set of potential candidates that a user might be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Recall Works\n",
    "Imagine you're on a shopping website. The system quickly looks at your browsing history, past purchases, and other data to find a large pool of products you might like. This could mean pulling up all electronics because you recently bought a new laptop, or all items in a specific category you frequently browse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal isn't to find the perfect item yet, but to efficiently find a wide array of possibilities. These candidates are then passed on to the next step, the ranking phase, which will score and sort them to find the best few to show you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step approach saves a lot of computing power and makes the entire recommendation process much faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategies for Scaling Down the Problem\n",
    "The recall phase addresses the problem we discussed at the beginning: how do we reduce the scale of a problem involving 360,000 articles and over 200,000 users? We can use the recall phase to filter a set of candidate articles for each user, thus reducing the problem's scale. Common recall strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **YouTube DNN Recall**: A deep learning approach that uses a user's past behavior (like watch and click history) to predict which articles they are most likely to click on. This is a very effective way to narrow down a huge list of candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**: This method finds articles that are similar to the ones a user has already clicked on, and adds these similar articles to the candidate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-based Collaborative Filtering**: This method finds other users who have similar interests and behavior as the user. It then recommends articles that those similar users have engaged with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content-based Filtering**: This approach uses article embedding vectors to measure the similarity between articles, and then performs recall based on this similarity. For example, models like Word2Vec or Doc2Vec can provide these embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Embedding**: Similar to content-based filtering, this method represents each user as a vector. It then finds other users with similar vectors and recommends their content. This is a powerful way to make personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods provides a unique way to calculate similarity, whether it's based on user behavior, article content, or a combination of both. By combining these strategies, we can create a robust and efficient system that provides a strong foundation for the final recommendation process."

    "The core idea behind user-based collaborative filtering is to recommend articles to a user that were clicked by other similar users. Since this involves the historical articles of similar users, we can still add some association rules to weight the articles that are likely to be clicked. The association rules used here primarily consider the relationship between the historical articles of similar users and the articles of the user being recommended to. The relationship here can directly borrow from the approach used in item-based collaborative filtering. This process accumulates weights for the items being recommended.\n",

    "- Calculate the similarity, creation time difference, and relative position sum between the articles clicked by the user being recommended to and the articles clicked by similar users. This sum serves as their respective weights.\n",

    "Cold-start is a classic problem in recommendation systems. It occurs when the system lacks sufficient data to make accurate recommendations. The problem can be broken down into three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Item Cold-Start**: This happens with new articles that have no click history. The challenge is to figure out how to recommend this new content to users. In our scenario, any article not present in the log data can be considered a cold-start article.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Cold-Start**: This affects new users who have just joined the platform and have no interaction history. The system doesn't know what to recommend. In our case, a user in the test set who has only clicked once could be considered a cold-start user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Cold-Start**: This is a combination of the above two problems. It happens when a brand new platform has no historical data for either users or articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our Current Cold-Start Challenge\n",
    "In our current dataset, we're facing significant cold-start issues: \n",
    "1. There are over 300,000 articles in the total library, but only around 30,000 of them have any click data. This means a huge number of articles have no interaction history, which is the definition of article cold-start.\n",
    "2. We also see signs of user cold-start: nearly 20% of the users in our test set have only one click. Recommending content to these users is difficult because we have very little to go on.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both of these problems are important, we'll focus primarily on article cold-start and its solutions. The user cold-start problem can be solved by recommending top articles, or passing the user embedding vector to the user tower of a two-tower model (e.g. YoutubeDNN) and retrieve most similar item embedding vectors via ANN (faiss).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Proposed Solution for Article Cold-Start\n",
    "Our goal isn't just to find articles that don't have click data, but to find articles that a user might actually click. We can treat this as a specialized recall strategy. Here's a possible approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding-based Recall: First, we can use item embeddings to find a set of articles that are similar to the ones a user has historically clicked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rule-based Filtering: From this recalled set, we can apply some simple rules to filter the articles. For example, we could keep only articles that match the user's preferred topics or reading length. We should also prioritize articles that were created around the same time as the user's last click, as this can capture a user's interest in a timely event.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is different from a standard embedding-based recall. Our goal is to find similar articles that have not appeared in the log data. This means we need to recall a larger number of candidates initially, as many will be filtered out by our cold-start rules."
